First repository - for esp8266 stuff
I am a frustrated golfer and tinkerer who's just looking to learn more about home automation, and the hardware and coding necessary to achieve it. I have messed around with the esp8266 and sonoffs but would like to improve my understanding to realise their full potential. Oh, and lowering my golf handicap would be nice as well!
